;<Nested Delay Subroutine>
;Program using 2 nested subroutines, ie, one nested subroutine called inside another nested subroutine called inside another nested subroutine

;data

LXI SP,0FFFH ;initialising stack pointer to 0x0FFF
JMP start ;go to label 'start' - main programme

;code

;Delay subroutine - called from the second delay subroutine

DELAY3:	PUSH PSW ;push flag and accumulator values into stack
	MVI B,02H ;load the value into register B

	;Loop using 8-bit B register for the third subroutine
	;Loop executed 2 times

	LOOP3:	DCR B ;decrement the register value
		JNZ LOOP3 ;if the previous operation doesn't result in zero, then jump to label 'loop3'
		POP PSW ;pop the top content of stack and put them in psw (accumulator and flag)
		RET ;return back to the second delay subroutine

;Delay subroutine - called from the first delay subroutine

DELAY2:	PUSH PSW ;push flag and accumulator values into stack
	MVI E,0EAH ;load the value into register E

	;Loop using 8-bit E register for the second subroutine
	;Loop executed 234 times

	LOOP2:	CALL DELAY3 ;call the third delay subroutine from the loop of second delay subroutine

;Delay subroutine - called from main programme

	;Loop using 8-bit D register for the first subroutine
	;Loop executed 64 times
