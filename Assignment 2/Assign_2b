;Program using one nested subroutine, ie, one subroutine called inside another subroutine

;data

LXI SP,0FFFH ;initialising stack pointer to 0x0FFF

;code

;Delay subroutine - called from the first delay subroutine

DELAY2:	PUSH PSW ;push flag and accumulator values into stack
	MVI E,0FFH ;load the value into register E

	;Loop using 8-bit E register for the second subroutine
	;Loop executed 255 times

	LOOP2:	DCR E ;decrement the register value
		JNZ LOOP2 ;if the previous operation doesn't result in zero, then jump to label 'loop2'
		POP PSW ;pop the top content of stack and put them in psw (accumulator and flag)
		RET ;return back to the first delay subroutine

;Delay subroutine - called from main programme

	;Loop using 8-bit D register for the first subroutine
	;Loop executed 255 times
